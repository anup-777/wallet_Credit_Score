This analysis evaluates the distribution and behavioral characteristics of wallets scored based on their activity in the Aave V2 protocol.

# Score Distribution
The wallets were assigned credit scores in the range of 0 to 1000. The distribution of scores across predefined ranges is as follows:

**Score Range**	     **Number of Wallets**
    0–100	           0
    100–200	         0
    200–300	         6
    300–400	         0
    400–500	         27
    500–600	         0
    600–700	         246
    700–800	         0
    800–900	         3217
    900–1000	       0

# Behavior of Wallets
**Wallets in the Lower Range (0–500)**
   ->Very few wallets fall in this category (only 33 wallets in total).
   ->These wallets exhibit limited or sporadic activity on the Aave V2 protocol.
   ->Their behavior might include infrequent deposits, minimal borrow-repay cycles, or early liquidations.
   ->Likely to be new, inactive, or opportunistic users.
**Wallets in the Middle Range (600–700)**
   ->A moderate number (246 wallets) fall here.
   ->These wallets are active but may not fully utilize borrowing or repayment features optimally.
   ->Could be consistent depositors with cautious borrowing.
   ->Wallets in the Higher Range (800–900)
   ->Majority of wallets (3217) lie in this range.
**These wallets demonstrate healthy financial behavior:**
   ->Frequent and timely repayments.
   ->Balanced use of borrowing and depositing.
   ->Rarely involved in liquidation events.
   ->Likely to be experienced DeFi users or institutional wallets.
   
# Conclusion
The score distribution shows a strong skew toward higher credit scores, indicating that most wallets interacting with Aave V2 maintain healthy on-chain behavior. This insight can help design risk models, reward mechanisms, or user segmentation strategies in DeFi protocols.
